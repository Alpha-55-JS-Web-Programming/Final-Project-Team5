- **Chat Interface: Where Conversations Flourish**
  <br />Zamo's chat interface provides users with a dynamic space for direct messaging with friends. Users can easily search for contacts, start one-on-one conversations, and utilize audio and video features. Adding reactions to messages adds expressiveness, while the ability to edit or delete messages gives users control over their communication.

- **Groups: Cultivating Collaborative Communities**
  <br />Zamo enables users to build stronger connections by creating and managing their own groups. During setup, users can add participants exclusively from their friend list, tailoring groups to specific interests or topics. Users have full control over their groups, with the ability to delete or leave them as needed, ensuring participation aligns with preferences and needs, creating a dynamic community environment.

- **Channels: Enriching Group Conversations**
  <br/>Upon the creation of a group in Zamo, a default #General channel is automatically established, serving as the foundational space for group discussions. However, the platform goes beyond this by empowering users with the capability to create additional channels within each group.
  <br/>The channels operate similarly to direct chats but are distinct in their facilitation of group conversations, allowing multiple users to engage with each other simultaneously.This feature is ideal for organizing discussions around specific topics, projects, or interests within the larger group context. Users who create channels retain the authority to delete them.

- **Contacts: Your Hub for Connections**
  The Contacts page in Zamo acts as a central hub for managing and expanding your friend network. It features a comprehensive list of current friends with an easy-to-use search function. Adding friends directly from this page streamlines the process, making your network easily accessible. Incoming friend requests are prominently displayed, simplifying the process of welcoming new connections into your circle.
